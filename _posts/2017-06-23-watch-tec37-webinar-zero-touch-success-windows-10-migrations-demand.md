<h2>Accelerate Windows 10 adoption and secure your organization</h2>
Constant advances in software and firmware threats make devices running Windows 7 prime targets for cyber attackers. Windows 10 addresses these threats, from device protection through breach response. A Windows 7 to 10 migration is one of the best steps an organization can take to stay out of the news.

We know a migration can seem daunting, almost impossible. But, it may not be as hard as you think.

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<strong>Why can’t I use the Windows 10 in-place migration to upgrade to Windows 10? It worked at home.</strong>

The Microsoft in-lace upgrade certainly provides a much easier and cost-effective path to Windows 10. However, it does not allow for more complex migrations, such as going from 32-bit to 64-bit and MBR to GPT conversions. It also doesn’t allow for the use of a reference Windows 10 image, which is a huge roadblock for enterprises. The bottom line is that many enterprises just aren’t capable of taking advantage of the Windows 10 in-place upgrade when migrating from Windows 7.


<strong>What’s the difference between USMT and CPMigrator? Sounds like they’re doing the same thing.</strong>

<a href="https://www2-dev.wwt.com/cpmigrator/">CPMigrator </a>actually leverages USMT to capture and restore user data and settings. It’s a great tool, free and in our opinion, the best at what it does. However, it’s limited in functionality and can be difficult to master. First off, USMT is just a data and settings migration tool, whereas CPMigrator provides the ability to deploy a Windows OS, install applications, join PCs to a domain, and integrate with products like Tanium. Second, USMT can be difficult to master as there are many different command line switches you must learn. Add in the fact there’s no GUI, it can take months of testing to find the right configuration. With CPMigrator, you can typically be up and running and performing migrations in days or weeks.
